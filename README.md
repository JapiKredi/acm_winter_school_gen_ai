## Module 1: Prompt Engineering
- We start by covering the fundamentals of Prompting. We utilize the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` open access model, which excels at following instructions. We demonstrate how to enable token streaming and employ chat templates.
- We dive into powerful prompting techniques like few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), Self Consistency, ReACT (Reason & Act), and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) with coding examples. We'll showcase a Breadth First Search based ToT example and Langchain tools for ReACT example.
- Explore JSON-only outputs, prompt chaining, and LLMs for evaluation. Plus, discover how to create a Gradio chatbot ðŸš€. Share your feedback and queries.
